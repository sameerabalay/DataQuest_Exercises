Read movie_metadata.csv into a list of lists and assign to movie_data.
Open and read the file movie_metadata.csv into a string variable.
Split the data into rows on the newline character ("\n").
Create an empty list, movie_data.
Loop through each row, and split each row into a list on the comma character (","), and append it to movie_data.
Display the first 5 lists in movie_data using the print() function.

-----
Write a function, with a definition, name, argument(s), body and return value, that returns a list containing the names of the movies in movie_data. This function is expected to behave similar to first_elt(), but for multiple lists.

Give the function a name that describes what it does; first_elts() is a good example, but feel free to be creative.
Declare an empty list.
Use a for loop to extract the first element of each list, and append these elements to the empty list.
Return the list.
Assign the returned list to movie_names.

Display the first 5 elements of movie_names using the print() function.

----
Write a function named is_usa() that checks whether or not a movie was made in the United States.
Check the movie_metadata.CSV file to see which column corresponds to the nationality of the movie. Don't forget to subtract one to find the true index of the column in the list.
Use an if statement to check the right column of the list with the word "USA". The equality operation is case sensitive, so make sure to get the capitilization right.
Return True if the condition is met, and False otherwise.
Try it with a few movies in movie_data.
Call it on wonder_woman and store the result in wonder_woman_usa.

----
Write a function index_equals_str() that takes in three arguments: a list, an index and a string, and checks whether that index of the list is equal to that string.

Call the function with a different order of the inputs, using named arguments.

Call the function on wonder_woman to check whether or not it is a movie in color, store it in wonder_woman_in_color, and print the value.

----
Write a function named feature_counter() that combines the logic of the index_equals_str() and counter() functions.
Use this to find out how many of the movies were made in USA, and store the value in num_of_us_movies.

----
Write a summary_statistics() function that will take movie_data as input, and output a dictionary that will give useful numbers from the data.
Define summary_statistics() with one argument, an input list.
Use the feature_counter() with the relevant arguments to count the following properties and make them equal to the corresponding variables.
Assign the number of movies made in Japan to num_japan_films.
Assign the number of movies in color to num_color_films.
Assign the number of movies in English to num_films_in_english.
Create a dictionary that associates the keys (japan_films,color_films,films_in_english) with the corresponding variables.
Return the dictionary.
Call the function with movie_data as its input, and store its value in summary.
